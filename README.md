## :exclamation: About

At the time of creating this site (Spring '24), I am a software engineer with two years of experience at Google. I'm getting ready to start my next opportunity search and figured it'd be a good idea to create an upgraded portfolio site to showcase my growth since the last version. If you have any feedback, it's always welcomed.

## :rocket: Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- React
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
